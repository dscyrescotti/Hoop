## 🎉 Motivation
As my New Year's resolution, I decided to explore something new and fun in the iOS ecosystem. I came up with the thought of building a small and simple game to experience the game development by learning SpriteKit API. As such, Hoop comes to life. Genuinely, the journey was not smooth enough and had some struggles with SpriteKit at the beginning because of my unfamilarity with the framework. However, I could manage to overcome burdens by researching on the framework along with the help of StackOverflow 😉. Overall, it was a fun and thrilling adventure of crafting it.

## 🔨 Build & Run
To get started, go to **Terminal** and run the following commands to clone and open the project.
```
> git clone https://github.com/dscyrescotti/Hoop.git
> cd Hoop && xed .
```
After seeing the project open, run the project by either using **⌘R** (Command+R) or clicking **Run** button in the project toolbar. That's it. Now you're ready to play!

## 🏅 Credits
Hoop is inspired by [Dunk Shot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dunk-shot/id1301375510) which is the fun and enjoyable game to paly.
> Hoop is just a hobby project to learn SpriteKit, so don't sue me for copying the idea. 🙏
